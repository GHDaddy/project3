    <h4>IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h4>

    <p>For almost as long as human beings have understood that the points of light circling the dome of the sky were other worlds and suns, we have speculated about life existing beyond the bounds of earth. When our understanding of the cosmos was tentative and fearful, such speculation was considered bizarre, even heretical: Giordano Bruno, one of the first to make a formal claim of a “plurality of worlds”, was burnt at the stake in 1600. </p>
    <p>Until the 1950’s, these conjectures were almost entirely fanciful: tales of moon maidens, yarns in pulp science fiction, Percival Lowell mapping nonexistentMartian canals. As we began to realize just how inhospitable conditions were outside the warm oasis of our planet – Venus a sulphuric hellhole, Mars a baked desert – we began to look further afield, into interstellar space. </p>
    <p>Much of this period has been focused on the possibility of life beyond our own solar system: with some 300 <em>billion</em> stars in the Milky Way alone, and programs like HARPS and Kepler detecting planets around them with increasing frequency, it would seem that no matter how rare and fortuitous the circumstances of our own evolution might be, the odds that we are the <em>only</em> sentient species in the universe are vanishingly small. But despite serious attempts to find traces of communication – the electromagnetic “leakage” or directed communications of other civilizations across the vast gulf of space – almost half a century of investigations have so far not yielded any firm data. </p>

      <p>Accepted ranges of heat, oxygenation, and chemicals as conditions for life have been wildly contradicted by the discovery of new extremophile species.</p>
      <p>Beginning around the 1980’s, astrobiologists brought their eyes considerably closer to home, seriously reconsidering the presence of life outside the bounds of Earth but within our own solar system. Part of this change was due to revelatory explorations of our own planet, and the recognition that our previous definitions of the conditions necessary for life, within accepted ranges of heat, oxygenation, and chemical balance, were wildly contradicted by the discovery of new species. Such “extremophiles” – thriving at crushing pressures, boiling and freezing temperatures, and far away from sunlight – made biologists reconsider the possibility of at least microbial or bacterial life on other planets in the solar system, even moons. At this point in time, the prime contenders as habitats for life are:</p>
